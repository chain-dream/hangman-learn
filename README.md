# Hangman (First Learning Version)

> It’s not perfect, but it works. And that’s enough for tonight. 🍻  


## What is this?
- This is a Hangman game (and a simple password generator) that I wrote while learning Python.

- The code structure is messy and has many global variables, but it **works**. A cleaner, refactored version will be released later.

## Run
```bash
python3 hangman.py
